# text-game-redux
A text based game made in C++, very much not done.

If you want a working demo use the "LlamaDemo" branch, it does not have some of the
same features aas master but I think it actually sort of works

The code is super messy plz ignore

Don't be afriad to add extra words in your commands to make more grammatical sense
the parser will (hopefully) ignore them. 

# Commands (llamaDemo)
