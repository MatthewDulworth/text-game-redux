# text-game-redux
The framework? for a text based game built in C++.

This project was more an exercise in creating the framework/engine for a text based adventure game than it was in game/level design. The current master branch is pretty far ahead of a only current demo (the llamaDemo branch), becuase of this. If you want to play this, download, build, and run, the llamaDemo branch. If you just want to poke around the code, go to dev or master.
